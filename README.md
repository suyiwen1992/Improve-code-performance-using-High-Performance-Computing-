# Improve-code-performance-using-High-Performance-Computing
Find all prime numbers within [1, n] using parallel programming using MPI. Code file Sieveprime1 implements the parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes and the program does NOT set aside memory for even integers. Sieveprime2 modifies the parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes program in Sieveprime1 so that each process of the program finds its own sieving primes via local computations instead of broadcasts. Sieveprime3 modify the parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes program in Sieveprime2 so that the program can have a more effective use of caches.
